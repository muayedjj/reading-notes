## ES6 Overview

> **ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMAScript International. It is used by applications to enable client-side scripting. The specification is influenced by programming languages like Self, Perl, Python, Java etc.** [1]

>ES6 or the ECMAScript 2015 is the 6th and major edition of the ECMAScript language specification standard. It defines the standard for the implementation of JavaScript and it has become much more popular than the previous edition ES5. [2]

ES6 comes with significant changes to the JavaScript language. It brought several new features like, let and const keyword, rest and spread operators, template literals, classes, modules and many other enhancements to make JavaScript programming easier and more fun. In this article, we will discuss some of the best and most popular ES6 features that we can use in your everyday JavaScript coding.

- let and const Keywords
- Arrow Functions
- Multi-line Strings
- Default Parameters
- Template Literals
- Destructuring Assignment
- Enhanced Object Literals
- Promises
- Classes
- Modules

**React is:**

- Easy to Learn and USe.
- Creating Dynamic Web Applications Becomes Easier.
- Reusable Components.
- Performance Enhancement.
- The Support of Handy Tools.
- Known to be SEO Friendly.
- The Benefit of Having JavaScript Library.

## Tailwind CSS

> Tailwind CSS is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override. 
The beauty of this thing called tailwind is it doesn’t impose design specification or how your site should look like, you simply bring tiny components together to construct a user interface that is unique. What Tailwind simply does is take a ‘raw’ CSS file, processes this CSS file over a configuration file, and produces an output. [3]

### Why Tailwind CSS?

- Faster UI building process
- It is a utility-first CSS framework which means we can use utility classes to build custom designs without writing CSS as in traditional approach. 
 
### Advantages of Tailwind CSS:

- No more silly names for CSS classes and Id’s.
- Minimum lines of Code in CSS file.
- We can customize the designs to make the components.
- Makes the website responsive.
- Makes the changes in the desired manner. 
- CSS is global in nature and if make changes in the file the property is changed in all the HTML files linked to it. But with the help of Tailwind CSS we can use utility classes and make local changes.
