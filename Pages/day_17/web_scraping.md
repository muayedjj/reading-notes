# **Web Scraping**

## **What Is Web Scraping?**

Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort. [1]

## Important notes about web scraping:
- Read through the websiteâ€™s Terms and Conditions to understand how you can legally use the data. Most sites prohibit you from using the data for commercial purposes. [1]

- Make sure you are not downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website. You may potentially be blocked from the site as well. [1]

## Inspecting the Website
The first thing that we need to do is to figure out where we can locate the links to the files we want to download inside the multiple levels of HTML tags. Simply put, there is a lot of code on a website page and we want to find the relevant pieces of code that contains our data. If you are not familiar with HTML tags, refer to [W3Schools Tutorials](http://www.w3schools.com/). It is important to understand the basics of HTML in order to successfully web scrape. [1]

## Web Scraping best practices to follow to scrape without getting blocked [2]

- Use Captcha Solving Services
- How can websites detect web scraping?
- How do you find out if a website has blocked or banned you?
