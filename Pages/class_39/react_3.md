## [React Context for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-context-for-beginners/)

> **React context is an essential tool for every React developer to know. I lets you easily share state in your applications.** [1]

### 1. **What is React context?**

React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our React app without using props.

_In other words, React context allows us to share data (state) across our components more easily._ [1]

### 2. **When to use React context**

React context is great when you are passing data that can be used in any component in your application.

These types of data include:

- Theme data (like dark or light mode)
- User data (the currently authenticated user)
- Location-specific data (like user language or locale)

**Data should be placed on React context that does not need to be updated often.**

Why? Because context was not made as an entire state management system. It was made to make consuming data easier.

_You can think of React context as the equivalent of global variables for our React components._ [1]

### 3. **What problems does React context solve?**

React context helps us avoid the problem of props drilling.

**The issue is that we are drilling some prop through multiple components that don't immediately need it.**

_This is the benefit of React context – we can bypass using props entirely and therefore avoid the issue of props drilling._ [1]
