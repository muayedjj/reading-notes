## [Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)

**Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.** [1]


## [Lists and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

**In React, transforming arrays into lists of elements is nearly identical.** [2]


## [Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

**HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.** [3]

## [Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)

**Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor.** [5]

## [Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)

**React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.** [6]

## [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

**One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. In this document, weâ€™ll walk you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table using React.** [7]
