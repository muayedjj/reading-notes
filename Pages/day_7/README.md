# **Python Scope & the LEGB Rule:** Resolving Names in Python Code

**In programming, the scope of a name defines the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name, such as variables, functions, objects, and so on. A name will only be visible to and accessible by the code in its scope.**

## **The LEGB rule**

**_The letters in the acronym LEGB stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in scopes_. This summarizes not only the Python scope levels but also the sequence of steps that Python follows when resolving names in a program.** [1]


## **The Two General Scopes:**

1. Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

2. Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.
